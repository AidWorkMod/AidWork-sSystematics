Thanks for downloading Baldi's Image Based Level Generator 1.1!

I hope you will enjoy using this tool as much as I did creating it!

Here's a quick start guide:

A new tab should of appeared in your unity editor named "JSP's Tools".

To open the tool's unity editor window, click on the "JSP's Tools" tab and then on Baldi's Image Based Level Generator. A window should pop up which is where you generate your level from!

Before generating a level though, you'll need an image file for it. If you haven't made one yet, this tool comes with several examples which you can use to get started.

In the unity editor project window, go to Tools->BIBLG->Textures->Examples and inside of that folder is where you will find 6 examples which are ready to be used.

To use an example image, open up the Baldi's Image Based Level Generator editor window and either drag or select one of the example image files as the level image file that you want to use.

After doing that and setting up the parameters for your level (like what materials you want to use for floors, walls, and ceilings) just click on the "Generate Level" button and your level will be generated in the scene that you are currently in!

Well, that should get you started with using it! If you have any questions, comments, or have suggestions, please feel free to send me an email at johnsterspaceprogram2@gmail.com or make a post on the tool's itch.io, gamebanana, or gamejolt page!
